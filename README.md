### Manual Subscription Plan Management
- **Subscription Plans** (Super Admin): Create and manage plans with name, description, validity (days), and features list. Activate or deactivate plans.
- **Upgrade Requests** (Super Admin): View all upgrade requests from shops. Approve or reject each request. On approval, the shop’s subscription is updated and expiry is recalculated from the new plan’s validity.
- **My Plan** (Shop Admin): View current plan (name, status, start/expiry, days remaining, features). See all available plans and submit an **upgrade request** with an optional message. Status shows “Pending approval” until Super Admin approves or rejects. No payment processing — all upgrades are manual and approval-based.

## 🚢 Production deployment

### Backend (production)

1. Set **NODE_ENV=production** in your host (e.g. PM2, Docker, or platform env).
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `.env` and set:
   - **MONGODB_URI** – production MongoDB URL
   - **JWT_SECRET** – strong secret (min 32 chars)
   - **FRONTEND_URL** – your frontend origin(s), e.g. `https://app.yourdomain.com` (comma-separated if multiple)
3. Install and start:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install --omit=dev && node server.js
   ```
4. Production behaviour: gzip **compression**, **helmet** security headers, **rate limiting** (100 req/15 min per IP), CORS restricted to **FRONTEND_URL**, request body limit 512kb, no stack traces in API errors.

### Frontend (production)

1. Set **VITE_API_URL** to your backend API base URL (e.g. `https://api.yourdomain.com/api`) in build env or `.env.production`.
2. Build:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
   ```
3. Serve the `frontend/dist` folder with any static host (Nginx, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
4. Build optimisations: **code splitting** (lazy routes + vendor chunks), **minification**, **console/debugger stripped**, **es2020** target.

## 🔐 Creating Super Admin

To create the first Super Admin user, you can use MongoDB directly or create a script:

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or via script
db.users.insertOne({
  email: "admin@washq.com",
  password: "$2a$12$hashedPasswordHere", // Use bcrypt to hash
  role: "SUPER_ADMIN",
  status: "ACTIVE",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
})
```

Or use the register endpoint (only for initial setup):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@washq.com",
    "password": "Admin123!",
    "role": "SUPER_ADMIN"
  }'
```

## 📋 Manual Subscription Workflow

This system has **no online payments**. All upgrades are requested by the shop admin and approved manually by the Super Admin.

### Subscription logic
- **SubscriptionPlan**: Created only by Super Admin. Fields: name, description, validity (days), features (list), status (Active/Inactive).
- **ShopSubscription**: Each shop has one current subscription: plan, start date, expiry date, status (Active / Expired / Pending Upgrade). Expiry is computed from start + plan validity days.
- **PlanUpgradeRequest**: Created by Shop Admin. Contains: shop, current plan, requested plan, message (optional), status (Pending / Approved / Rejected), actioned date. Only one Pending request per shop at a time.

### How to create plans (Super Admin)
1. Go to **Subscription Plans** in the side menu.
2. Click **Add Plan**.
3. Enter plan name, description, validity in days, and features (one per line). Set Active/Inactive.
4. Save. The plan appears in the list and is available for shops to request (if Active).

### How to approve upgrades (Super Admin)
1. Go to **Upgrade Requests** in the side menu.
2. You see all requests with shop name, current plan → requested plan, request date, and status.
3. Click **Approve** or **Reject** (or **View details** first).
4. On **Approve**: The shop’s subscription is updated to the requested plan, start date = today, expiry = start + plan validity days. Request is marked Approved and actioned date is set.
5. On **Reject**: Request is marked Rejected. No change to the shop’s subscription.

### Shop Admin flow
1. Go to **My Plan**.
2. Section 1 shows **Current plan** (name, status, start, expiry, days remaining, features).
3. Section 2 shows **Available plans** (read-only). Each has a **Request upgrade** button (disabled if that plan is current or if a request is already Pending).
4. Click **Request upgrade** → modal: optional message to admin → **Submit request**.
5. After submit, status shows “Pending approval” and duplicate requests are disabled until the request is approved or rejected.

## 🔔 WhatsApp Status Alerts (Click-to-Chat)

The app includes a **manual WhatsApp status alert** system. There is **no WhatsApp API** and **no automation**: the shop admin clicks a button and WhatsApp opens with a pre-filled message to the customer (wa.me link). The admin sends the message manually from their device.

### How it works
- **Shop WhatsApp number**: Configured in **Admin → WhatsApp Settings**. Used as the “from” context (your shop); the actual chat is opened on the device where the admin clicks (wa.me opens chat to the **customer** with the message pre-filled).
- **Templates**: In **WhatsApp Settings** you can edit message templates for each job status: **Received**, **In Progress**, **Completed**, **Delivered**. Placeholders are replaced when the link is built:
  - `{{name}}` – customer name  
  - `{{vehicleNumber}}` – vehicle number  
  - `{{token}}` – job token  
- **Job Details page**: For each job you get:
  - **Status update button** (primary): e.g. “Mark In Progress”, “Mark Completed”, “Mark Delivered”.
  - **Send [Status] WhatsApp** button (green): opens WhatsApp to the customer with the template for the **current** status filled in. Disabled if the shop WhatsApp number is missing, the template is empty, or the customer has no phone.
- **After delivery**: When status is **Delivered**, an **Ask for Google Review** button appears. It opens WhatsApp with a thank-you message and your **Google Review URL** (set in WhatsApp Settings). Disabled if the review link or customer phone is missing.

### Editing templates
1. Go to **Admin → WhatsApp Settings**.
2. Under **WhatsApp Message Templates**, edit the text for Received, In Progress, Completed, and Delivered.
3. Use only the allowed placeholders: `{{name}}`, `{{vehicleNumber}}`, `{{token}}`.
4. Click **Save Templates**. Use **Reset to Default** to restore the default texts.

### Placeholder usage
- `{{name}}` – Replaced with the customer’s name.  
- `{{vehicleNumber}}` – Replaced with the car’s number/plate.  
- `{{token}}` – Replaced with the job token number.  

All replacement is done in the frontend when building the wa.me link; the backend does not send any WhatsApp message.

### API and settings
- **GET /api/admin/settings** – Returns `shopWhatsappNumber`, `googleReviewLink`, `whatsappTemplates` (received, inProgress, completed, delivered).
- **PUT /api/admin/settings** – Accepts the same fields to update.
- **PATCH /api/admin/jobs/:id/status** – Updates job status (no WhatsApp sending from backend).

### Edge cases
- **Missing WhatsApp number**: WhatsApp buttons are disabled until a shop WhatsApp number is set in WhatsApp Settings.
- **Missing Google Review link**: “Ask for Google Review” is disabled until a Google Review URL is set.
- **Job already delivered**: Only “Send Delivered WhatsApp” and “Ask for Google Review” are shown.
- **Duplicate clicks**: Each click opens a new tab; a short success toast is shown. No server-side rate limit for opening links.

## 🔔 WhatsApp API (Optional)

The platform may also include WhatsApp API integration placeholders for automated messages. To enable automated sending:

1. Set up WhatsApp Business API (Twilio, Meta, etc.)
2. Update `backend/utils/whatsapp.utils.js` with your API credentials
3. Configure templates in the admin panel

The **status alert** feature above does **not** use the API; it is purely click-to-chat (wa.me) from the Job Details page.

## 📧 Email Integration

Email service is configured for OTP delivery. To enable:

1. Set up email service (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
2. Update `backend/utils/email.utils.js` with your SMTP credentials
3. Configure email settings in `.env`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for production

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

**Frontend:**

npm run build
# Serve the dist folder with a static server
```

### Environment Variables for Production
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Use strong `JWT_SECRET`
